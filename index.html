                <h1 class="page-title"> Providence, RI to Seattle, WA </h1>
                
                <p class="subtitle"> Four Thousand Miles Via Bicycle </p>
                
                <h2> A photographic Journal </h2>
                
                <p class="intro"><span class="run-in"> On the 13th of June, Two Thousand Twelve, </span> I left Philadelphia knowing that I would ride a bicycle across the country with my best friend in support of affordable housing efforts. Some of my assumptions came to fruition. I would fall in love with the Pacific Northwest. My nostalgia for my nation would grow. I would develop an insane, irreversible farmer's tan.</p>

                <p>What I did not know, is that my life would be completely changed. I would make 29 other friendships that I would cherish forever. I would develop an addiction to the outdoors. I would learn the great value and satisfaction in community service. I would discover an inner peace in physical exertion and manual labor. Above all, I would critically evaluate my goals and purpose on earth, and forgoe my ambitions of salary and materials, make the decision to leave my job, and pursue personal efforts and projects I had long put aside. 
                </p>

                <p>This is for Bike and Build, Providence To Seattle, Two Thousand and Twelve. For the open road, the adventure, the good times and the tough, the brutal heat and the biting wind, the glacial swims and playground romps, the words exchanged, and the lessons learned. 
                </p>

                <p>For all of you.</p>

                <p>You, who regardless of confidence or experience or certainty, were all so bold in spirit to embark on such a task. You, who were tougher, or dumber, or both, than those who called us crazy as we passed. You, who rode triumphantly accross this nation smiling ear to ear. You. My companions, my friends, my family from afar, who quietly walk through the back of my brain and utter words of confidence and joy.</p>

                <p>I read this quote from Jon Krakauer a few months ago, and though it has been shared widely, I think it summarizes my thoughts quite well.</p>

                <blockquote>Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.
                </blockquote>

                <p>This reality was ours for a mere 3 months. But in that time, I did more living than I thought possible. I aim to set forth on this path again. Bitter is the feeling of longing for you all. Sweet is the feeling of knowing that you helped me self-actualize. I've held on to these photos for a long time, but I hope they help inspire you. The memories I have 
                </p>

                <p>
                This moment marks a turning point in my life. A new road to travel, without a queue sheet, risky, and I fear it contains a good deal of rocks. But the freedom tastes as sweet as the ice cream in Winthrop. Our experience took on varied signifigance for each of us, but I hope you are all living today, as you want to be. I'll be traveling the country this summer. I do hope our paths cross again.
                </p>

                <p> Now, <a href="memory.html">on to the photos &rarr;</a></p>
