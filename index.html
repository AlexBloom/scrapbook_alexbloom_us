                <p class="subtitle"> Four Thousand Miles Via Bicycle </p>
                <h2> A photographic Journal </h2>
                <p class="intro"><span class="run-in"> In Mid-June of Two Thousand Twelve, </span> I left Philadelphia knowing that I would ride my bicycle across the country with my best friend in support of affordable housing efforts. What I did not know, is that my life would be completely changed. I would make 29 other friendships that I would cherish forever, and I would make a healthy re-evaluations of my lifestyle and attitude. Riding with an organization called Bike and Build, we set out from Providence, Rhode Island after several days of orientation, safety clinics and a shakedown ride.</p>

                <p>The raw experience of traveling by bicycle is unparralleled. No motorized vehicle can bring the traveler such an intimate relationship with his surroundings. Every inch of ground, every hill, every bump, is not only observed by ones eyes, but felt down to one's bones. In a car or train, the effects of the weather are diminished to a matter of convenience; even a motorcycle offers a rider opportunities to outrun poor conditions and wear heavy protective clothing. But on a bicyle, in the open country, you are completely at the mercy of the elements: mild conditions are appreciated like the gift of life itself, but extreme heat, cold, rain, wind, and humidity become brutal enemies. </p>

                <h1> Memory </h1> 
                <p> <span class="run-in">Anticipating wild weather and tough terrain,</span> I took an old Holga camera that I wouldn't be afraid to break or lose. Luckily I managed to capture a few snapshots that help tell the story of my life's best adventure so far. </p>
                <p> As time rolls beyond the final day of our trip, I've felt a rising fear of losing the memories into oblivion. I've looked at these when I've wanted to remember, and a glance brings back an entire day on the bike and a world of stories.</p>

                <h1> Land </h1>
                <p> <span class="run-in"> There was a moment </span> during a ride in Nebraska, when I had an epiphany about the geography of the United States. I had first thought about following the westward expansion of Europeans, and later about the lives of Native Americans, but at this moment, I realized something greaterâ€”we were not just crossing America, we were crossing the continent. Ages upon ages of natural force have shaped the landscape: as we moved into areas with less people, it became easier to comprehend the times when people didn't walk this land. North America is vastly diverse in its geography, and it's beauty was amplified by an awareness, albeit minimal, of the forces that shaped it.</p>

                <h1> Signs </h1>
                <p> An item of my particular interest, signs tell stories about our culture, our economy, our values. The ideals and attitudes of America have been carefully recorded; we can see our history on the front of grocers, garages, bars and arenas. There are places in our country where time moves more slowly, and in these places, we can see elements of culture that we have lost, and those we have gained. </p>
